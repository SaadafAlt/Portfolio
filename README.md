# Saadaf's Portfolio

Hello! My name is Saadaf. I hope you're well. Welcome to my portfolio repo.

# Identity
The website's design is inspired by the _Nothing_ phone's brand identity, Metal Gear Solid user interfaces, 90's electroluminescent gauge clusters, and tempered glass. Refer to the moodboard below.

It all really kicked off when I saw the image of the _Nothing_ phone, and how its hovering over a backdrop with colours that reminded me of tempered glass. I then remembered how much I love the green of tempered glass. Overall, I feel whoever took the picture of the _Nothing_ phone may have also been inspired by the colours of glass the same way I did. There's a certain demeanor about that image and the identity of the brand; **stealthy**, **dystopian**, **intense**. I could use the same words to descibe the user experience _Metal Gear Solid_ delivers to us. Additionally however, with inspiration from 90's electroluminescent gauge clusters, also **nostalgic** at the same time.
