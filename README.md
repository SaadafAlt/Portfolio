# Saadaf's Portfolio

Hello! My name is Saadaf. I hope you're well. Welcome to my portfolio repo.

# Identity
The aesthetic of my website. My website's design is inspired by the _Nothing_ phone's brand identity, Metal Gear Solid user interfaces, 90's electroluminescent gauge clusters, and tempered glass. Refer to the moodboard below. Additionally, I used figma to prepare designs for the website.
