# Saadaf's Portfolio

Hello! My name is Saadaf. I hope you're well. Welcome to my portfolio.

# Identity
The website's design is inspired by the _Nothing_ phone's brand identity, Metal Gear Solid user interfaces, 90's electroluminescent gauge clusters, and tempered glass. Refer to the moodboard below.

It all really kicked off when I saw the image of the _Nothing_ phone, and how its hovering over a backdrop with colours that reminded me of tempered glass. I then remembered how much I love the green of tempered glass. Overall, I feel whoever took the picture of the _Nothing_ phone may have also been inspired by the colours of glass the same way I did. There's a certain demeanor about that image and the identity of the brand; **stealthy**, **dystopian**, **intense**. I could use the same words to descibe the user experience that _Metal Gear Solid_ successfully executes. In addition to **dystopian** - with inspiration from retro electroluminescent gauge clusters, the identity simultaneously attempts to deliver a feeling of **nostalgia** as well.
